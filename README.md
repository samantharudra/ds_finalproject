# Assessing the Impact of Pandemic Learning Models In Pennsylvania Educational Outcomes Using Spatial Matching

## Description
As the education system grapples with the side effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic, we question if similar school districts with different covid-19 policy choices have had different educational outcomes in the year following. We first analyzed district level data in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, looking at how long districts were in-person during the 2020-2021 school year. Using spatial matching to create pairs of similar districts based on demographics but with different Covid policies, we then examined their test scores from before and after the pandemic.
